| 2 | x | Stuff of t and biology’s unique laws of dynamics.  Dynamical phenomena in both the nonliving and the living.  The great principles of dynamics and their biological consequences.  Biology’s unique answer to purposeful dynamics. Making our guesses precise: null hypotheses.  When guesses become probability distributions.  The great distributions: binomial, Poisson, exponential and their important biological consequences. | x |
| 3 | x | What is Frank talking about?  The physics-biology interface in Dresden
and insights into a host of interesting problems. | x |
| 4 | x | Representing and Approximating Life.  Rethinking the idea of a vector: from Descartes (x,y) to ChatGPT. Weird vectors, from personality type to cell shape to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. | x |
| 5 | x | The Value and Values of Science.  The mystery of the world and the value of wonder.  Loving the questions.  Research as exploratory dynamics. | x |
