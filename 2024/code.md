For a combination of pedagogical and logistical reasons, all of the programming in the course is done in Python using Google Colab notebooks.

Content will be posted here as the course progresses!

## Tutorial Schedule
There are two notebooks for you to explore independently:
- [Tutorial 0: Introduction to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fq_HaiuYb1L18uGcoA3eGs6taiUafR-6?usp=sharing) covers our approach to programming in this course, including instructions on how to submit your homework correctly. 
- [Tutorial 0: Introduction to Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WGEmPLcuYrGZ7IfvKAqWjRi7yTrTx6k9?usp=sharing) is a gentle, abridged introduction to the Python programming language.
It's far from comprehensive, but if you're new to the subject, it pairs well with the other tutorials below.
